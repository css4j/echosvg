/**
 * PathLayout can layout text along a Shape, usually a Path object.
 * <p>
 * There are a number of improvements that could be made to this class. I'll try
 * to list some of them:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The layout should really only modify the GlyphVector, rather than
 * converting to a Shape.
 * <li>Maybe the functions should take a AttributedCharacterIterator or
 * something? Should this class do the entire layout?
 * <li>The layout code works, but it's definitely not perfect.
