# Image comparisons in tests

<br/>

## Introduction
Most of the testing infrastructure relies on image comparisons, and understanding
how they are done is essential. When a test produces an image (the "candidate"
image), it is compared to a reference image (stored somewhere under the
`test-references` top-level directory), and the test is only successful if the
two images are considered similar enough.

However, images generated by a test may not exactly match the ones that were
produced on a different platform, or with a different version of Java or the
operating system. The image comparison infrastructure must allow for this, while
at the same time being sensitive enough to catch real issues.

<br/>

## The comparison procedure
First, the two images are compared, and most tests allow a small percentage of
different pixels between them. The allowance is split by a threshold: if the
difference in the pixel value is under that threshold, an under-threshold
allowance is applied, while if the threshold is exceeded a different tolerance
applies.

In most cases a small allowance of 0.00001% is used (if not exactly zero), while
in others the comparison is crafted so a larger number of pixels with small
departures from the reference are allowed. For example, in the comparisons
between normal renderings and renders with SVG fonts (where differences are
unavoidable), a split tolerance of 0.65% and 0.004% is used as of this writing.

If the two images match within the allowed margins, the match is successful. If
the images do not match, then the candidate image is stored in a directory named
`candidate-reference` under the relevant subdirectory of `test-references`. In
case one wants to accept the new image as the new reference, just copy it to its
parent directory, overwriting the previous one.

In some tests, once this first comparison does not match, nothing more is done
and the test fails. However, the rendering (and related) tests attempt to
account for variations. Variations (or "variants") are images that represent the
differences between the reference and an accepted image.

<br/>

## Understanding variations
Allowed variations are stored in directories called `accepted-variation`, also
under the appropriate subdirectory of `test-references`. For example, accepted
variations for the rendering of scripting samples are found under

`test-references/samples/tests/spec/scripting/accepted-variation`

When variation-aware tests fail, they store a couple of variations under the
`candidate-variation` subdirectory. In the above example case:

`test-references/samples/tests/spec/scripting/candidate-variation`

If, for example, the `fill` test fails, two variations shall be stored there:

- `fill.png`
- `fill_platform.png`

The first image is called the _range_ variant and the second is the _platform_
variant. To deal with the usual, small random variations in rendering we want to
use the range variant, while to account for —generally large— systematic platform
differences one shall use platform variants. As of this writing, a couple of
platform variants are accepted: one for the Xfce desktop environment, and another
for Windows Server 2025. They use the [`xfce` and `windows-2025` suffixes](https://github.com/css4j/echosvg/blob/1-stable/echosvg-test/src/test/java/io/sf/carte/echosvg/test/svg/PreconfiguredRenderingTest.java#L49).

The following is an example of a platform variation image:

![Variant example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/css4j/echosvg/v2.4/test-references/samples/tests/spec/color/accepted-variation/systemColors_xfce.png)

To enable a range variant, move the variant to the `accepted-variation` directory.
If a range variant was already there, just overwrite it (the new range variant
accounts for the previous one). Before enabling a range variant, make sure that
it is small enough to be acceptable: platform variants are better suited for large
variations.

To accept a platform variant, replace the `_platform` suffix in the filename
with the (supported) suffix corresponding to your platform. In our example, if
our platform is Xfce we would rename `fill_platform.png` into `fill_xfce.png`
and then move it to `accepted-variation`.

Range variants are more accurate than platform variants, as the differences in
the latter are widened to allow an easier visual inspection.

If you want an additional platform variant to be supported (like a MacOS variant)
please open an issue for it.

## Examining a failed comparison

When a generated image does not match the reference, a side-by-side and a diff
image are saved into the project's `build/reports/tests/test/images` directory.

This is an example of a side-by-side comparison:
<img width="900" height="500" alt="gradientLimit side-by-side" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c7e1009-d085-42f0-b6b6-ddcc1af3e448" />

and here is the corresponding diff:

<img width="450" height="500" alt="gradientLimit diff" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/313c1741-4c39-4572-ab24-ecf196d388d4" />

## Media Query-specific tests

The SVG2 tests can be run with different Media Query-matching configurations
like the `print` medium or the dark mode (`prefers-color-scheme: dark`); in that
case the reference and variant images carry the appropriate suffix(es).

For example, the [`css3.html`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/css4j/echosvg/v2.4/samples/tests/spec2/styling/css3.html)
test has three reference images: [`css3.png`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/css4j/echosvg/v2.4/test-references/samples/tests/spec2/styling/css3.png)
(light mode and `screen` medium which is the default), [`css3-print.png`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/css4j/echosvg/v2.4/test-references/samples/tests/spec2/styling/css3-print.png)
(`print` medium) and [`css3-dark.png`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/css4j/echosvg/v2.4/test-references/samples/tests/spec2/styling/css3-dark.png)
(default medium and dark mode).
