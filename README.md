# Echo SVG

 EchoSVG is a fork of Apache Batik, a Java based toolkit for applications which
handle images in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format for various purposes,
such as viewing, generation or manipulation.

 Thanks to its usage of the CSS4J style parser, supports level 4 selectors and
RGBA color values.


## Building

 To build from source, currently the latest CSS4J code is required, which means
that you have to [build CSS4J from the latest Git](https://github.com/css4j/css4j-dist/)
first. Once you have installed CSS4J, run `mvn clean install`.
