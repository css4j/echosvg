# EchoSVG

 EchoSVG is a fork of Apache Batik, a Java based toolkit for applications which
handle images in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format for various purposes,
such as viewing, generation or manipulation.

 Thanks to its usage of the CSS4J style parser, supports level 4 selectors and
RGBA color values.


## Building

 To build from source, you need the latest versions of [CSS4J](https://css4j.github.io/)
and [JCLF](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jclf/), which can be installed with the
[`install-css4j.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/css4j/css4j-dist/master/install-css4j.sh)
and [`install-jclf.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/css4j/css4j-dist/master/install-jclf.sh)
scripts. Once you have installed those dependencies, run `mvn clean install`.
